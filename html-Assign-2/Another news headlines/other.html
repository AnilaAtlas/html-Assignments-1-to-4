    <h1>Yasmin Arkinstall was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder in her early 20s. Now she's telling her story through opera.</h1>
    <p>
    <big>For years, 28-year-old Yasmin Arkinstall believed the intrusive thoughts in her head were symptoms of a generalised anxiety disorder. It's what psychologists had always told her.
    But when Arkinstall, a classically trained vocalist and opera performer, was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) at 21, her understanding of herself and her thoughts changed.
    OCD is generally defined as recurrent and intrusive thoughts, urges and images that can cause anxiety or distress.  
    It's estimated 3 per cent of Australia's population, or around 780,000 people, will experience OCD in their lives.
    <blockquote><q> lot of my OCD is pure obsessional, meaning that a lot of it happens in my mind. I don't have a lot of outward compulsions that people would notice as the classic OCD symptoms,</q> yasmin </blockquote> </big>
