       <big> Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip - It is bitterly cold, and people are trying to build adequate shelter to protect themselves in a new refugee camp set up in Deir el-Balah to cope with the overwhelming numbers of people fleeing in search of safety.
In the camp, which is close to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, children run from tent to tent, borrowing items, carrying messages, or looking for someone to play with because that’s what children do.
Al Jazeera spoke to five Palestinians in the camp about their hopes and fears for 2024 amid Israel’s devastating war on Gaza.

    As the drone of Israeli aircraft filled the air, Um Shadi recounted the horrors of the past few weeks.
 <blockquote> <q> We’ve been moving as fast as we can to stay safe, out of our home when we were hit, my daughter’s home was hit, everything was hit </q> she said. </blockquote>
 The family came to Deir el-Balah last week after the Israeli army dropped leaflets on the school they were sheltering in, telling everyone to leave and head south.<q>So we ran, grabbed the kids and ran, </q> Um Shadi said. <br>
 <q> We spent the first night in the open air. Everyone woke up ill because it was so cold. A wonderful man gave us a tent, and we’ve been trying to find wood to burn for warmth and materials to close off the tent better.
 For the new year, I pray for ‘faraj’ [joy or relief after sadness and calamity]. Please God let everyone go back safely to their homes, please protect the people, all the people. I pray this war ends… every minute I pray. </q> <br>
